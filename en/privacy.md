# 10. Security


## a. General

Autify is very concerned with safeguarding your information. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our site or the Service, you can contact us at [info(at)autify.com]("mailto:info@autify.com"). We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored ‟personal data” (as defined in applicable laws) to you via email or conspicuous posting on our site as soon as possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. 


## b. Phishing

Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to Autify. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your Autify Account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.


#  11. Our Policy Towards Children

The Service and our site are not directed to individuals under 18. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at [info(at)autify.com]("mailto:info@autify.com"). If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.
